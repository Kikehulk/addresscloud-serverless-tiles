# Serverless Vector Tiles on AWS
This tutorial and accompanying presentation is based on a talk I gave at [FOSS4G 2018 in Tanzania](https://2018.foss4g.org/) and will cover off the following tasks:

1. Host a simple webpage on AWS (Hello S3!)
2. Host the webpage from our own domain (Hello Route 53!)
3. Create a free HTTPS cert for our domain (Hello ACM!)
4. Publish our simple webpage to a CDN with SSL support (Hello CloudFront!)
5. Add a map (Hello Vector Tiles!)
6. Publish ready-made OSM tiles to S3/CloudFront
7. Publish our own geo data to S3/CloudFront

Once complete you should have something like this running on your own domain on AWS and costing you next to nothing to host!

You can play around with this yourself at the [Demo Site](https://www.myvectortiles.xyz/)

### Pre-Requisites

-	An AWS account
-	A domain name that can be used for the exercise (this will need to be re-pointed so make sure it is not being used for anything else!). namecheap.com have domains starting at $0.48 per year but make sure you switch off auto-renew!
-	Patience â€“ there is a lot of AWS config to make this work and no sign of a map until Step 5 but this will be worth it, trust me

### Materials

There are a lot of steps involved and a lot of new concepts to learn and so the recommended approach is to [Download the Tutorial](https://github.com/addresscloud/serverless-tiles/raw/master/Serverless%20Vector%20Tiles%20on%20AWS.pdf) and work through this in order as each step builds on the last and a small oversight in config earlier on could easily cause problems later.
